# ICT-Project
# Project Name: Umbrella
# Objective:
The main aim of our project was to create a website through which the user could visit websites of different genre through one place by using the knowledge of web development that we gained in ICT course and through the internet.
# Project Description:
The final product of our project was a website. We demonstrated our frontend development skills in this project. It was a non-responsive website, as we were at beginner level of web development. The website was capable enough of letting the user navigate backward and forward. The website consisted of homepage and other web pages directing from homepage. The web pages consisted of header that allowed user to move towards various sections of the page, and a footer that had functional logos of various social media handles and a button that takes the user to the top of the page. The home page consisted of about section, team section and a dummy responsive section. The other pages could be reachable by clicking the mentioned button in the section below the header of home page. In the other web pages, there were information about the websites of that specific genre. One could easily visit  the websites by clicking the name or the images of the mentioned websites.
# My contribution:
I did major portion of the designing part by using CSS. I was tasked to make the links and buttons functional, which I did religiously.
